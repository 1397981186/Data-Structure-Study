/**
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-
place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order 
red, white, and blue. 

 We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and 
blue, respectively. 

 You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function. 

 
 Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

 Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

 
 Constraints:
 n == nums.length 
 1 <= n <= 300 
 nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2. 

 Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant 
extra space?
